gentle-itunes
================

[Alfred Extension](http://www.alfredapp.com/powerpack/) to play or pause iTunes with a gentle fade in/out. Install the extension and then enable a Hotkey to trigger it (I use ⌥-↓).

# Installation
Simply double click on the Gentle iTunes.alfredextension (assuming you have Alfred installed). You will be walked through the installation procedures.
